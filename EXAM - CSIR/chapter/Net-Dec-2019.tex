\item An ice cube of volume $10 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ is floating over a glass of water of $10 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ cross-section area and $10 \mathrm{~cm}$ height. The level of the water is exactly at the brim of the glass. Given that the density of ice is $10 \%$ less than that of water, what will be the situation when ice melts completely?
 \begin{tasks}(2)
	\task[\textbf{a.}] the level falls by $10 \%$ of the side of the cube.
	\task[\textbf{b.}] The level falls by $10 \%$ of the original height of the water column
	\task[\textbf{c.}]The level increases by $10 \%$ of the side of the cube and water spills out
	\task[\textbf{d.}]  There is no change in the level of the water.

\item  In a very old, stable forest, a particular species of plants grows to a maximum height of $3 \mathrm{~m}$. In a large survey, it is found that $30 \%$ of the plants have heights less than $1 \mathrm{~m}$ and $50 \%$ have heights more than $2 \mathrm{~m}$. From these observations we can say that the height of the plants increases
	 \begin{tasks}(2)

		\task[\textbf{b.}]at the fastest rate when they are between $1 m$ and $2 m$ tall
		\task[\textbf{c.}]at the fastest rate when they are more than $2 m$ tall
		\task[\textbf{d.}]  at the same rate at all stages

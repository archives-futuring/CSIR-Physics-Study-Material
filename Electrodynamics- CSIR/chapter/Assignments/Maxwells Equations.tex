	\item A uniform magnetic field in the positive $z$-direction passes through a circular wire loop of radius $1 \mathrm{~cm}$ and resistance $3.14 \Omega$ lying in the $x y$-plane. The field strength is reduced from 10 tesla to 9 tesla in $1 s$. Find the charge transferred across any point in the wire. 
	\item A small loop of wire of area $A=0.01 \mathrm{~m}^{2}, N=40$ turns and resistance $R=10 \Omega$ is initially kept in a uniform magnetic field $B$ in such a way that the field is normal to the loop. When it is pulled out of the magnetic field, a total charge of $Q=2 \times 10^{-5} C$ flows through the coil. Find the magnitude of the field $B$.
	\item A rectangular loop of dimension $L$ and width $w$ moves with a constant velocity $v$ away from an infinitely long straight wire carrying a current $I$ in the plane of the loop as shown in the figure below. Let $R$ be the resistance of the loop. Show that the current in the Toop at the instant the near side is at a distance $r$ from the wire is $\frac{\mu_{0} I L}{2 \pi R} \frac{w v}{r[r+w]}$.

Find an expression for the $x$-component of the force $\vec{F}$ acting on the loop in terms of its velocity $\vec{v}(t), B, L$ and $R$.
\item A coil of 15 turns, each of radius 1 centimeter, is rotating at a constant angular velocity $\omega=300$ radians per second in a uniform magnetic field of $0.5$ tesla, as shown in the figure. Assume at time $t=0$ that the normal $\hat{n}$ to the coil plane is along the $y$-direction and that the self-inductance of the coil can be neglected. If the coil resistance is 9 ohms, what will be the magnitude of the induced current in milliamperes?

	\item Consider a capacitor placed in free space, consisting of two concentric circular parallel plates of radii $r$. The separation $z$ between the plates oscillates with a constant frequency $\omega$, i.e. $z(t)=z_{0}+z_{1} \cos \omega t$. Here $z_{0}$ and $z_{1}\left(<z_{0}\right)$ are constants. The separation $z(t)$ $(<<r)$ is varied in such a way that the voltage $V_{0}$ across the capacitor remains constant,\\
	(a) Calculate the displacement current density and the displacement current between the plates through a concentric circle of radius $r / 2$.\\
	(b) Calculate the magnetic field vector $(\vec{H})$ between the plates at-a distance $r / 2$ from the axis of the capacitor.

\chapter{Special Theory of Relativity}
The $20^{\text{th }}$ century saw essentially two major triumphs in physics: the discovery of quantum mechanics and the discovery of relativity.
\section{Reference Frame}
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.40\textwidth}

	\caption{Reference Frame}
\end{wrapfigure}
Reference frames are physico-mathematical structures that have the purpose of allowing the objective description, also from a quantitative viewpoint, of physical phenomena that are observed in nature.\\
In order to describe the motion of a particle in space, we need to know its position at different instants of time. This needs the choice of reference body or coordinate system. If we imagine a coordinate system attached to a rigid body and we describe the position of any particle relative to it, then such a coordinate system is called frame of reference. For the location of the objects, the position vectors are drawn from the origin $O$ of the coordinate system . \textbf{A reference frame with four coordinates $\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}, \mathrm{z}, \mathrm{t}$ is referred as space-time frame}. The simplest frame of reference is a cartesian coordinate system. 
\subsection{Inertial Frame of Reference}
Inertial frames are frames in which Newton's laws of motion holds true.
It is the one in which the law of inertia holds true i.e., if a particle, subject to no external force, is found to move in a straight line with constant velocity (or to remain at rest), then the coordinate system used for this purpose is called inertial frame.
\begin{align*}
\intertext{We know that according to  Newton's second law of motion,}
F&=\frac{dP}{dt}\\
&=\frac{d(mV)}{dt}
\intertext{If\ $F=0$}
\frac{dV}{dt}&=0
\intertext{Then velocity is constant in inertial frame of reference.}
\end{align*}
Inertial frames are  related by a constant velocity along any axis.  An object is at rest in an inertial frame when it's position in space does not change with time.\\
 
\subsection{Non-Inertial Frame of Reference}
 Accelerated frame of reference in which Newton's law does not hold good.\\\\
 If there is an observer  in a rotating frame then, according to the obeserver a person standing out of his  frame is seems to be accelerating , and then,  according to the observer ,  a force seems to be acting on the person. Then , first law of motion will not be holding in an accelerated frame.
\section{Galilean Transformation } 
An event or physical phenomena, observed simultaneously in two separate reference frames, will have to separate set of coordinates. \textbf{Equation relating two coordinate system  is called transformation equation.} \\
Let $ S $ and $ S^{\prime} $ be two inertial frame of reference with observer at origin $\mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{O}^{\prime}$ moving with a relative velocity $y$ along positive direction of $x$.
The Galilean transformation successfully explained the invariance of laws of Newtonian mechanics in different inertial frame. Let the coordinates $(x, t)$ denote the location of an event in the non moving frame $s$ and $\left(x^{\prime}, t^{\prime}\right)$ denote the location of the same event in the moving frame $s^{\prime}$. The Galilean transformation which relates the two coordinate systems is:
\begin{align*}
	x^{\prime} &=x-v t \\
	y^{\prime} &=y \\
	z^{\prime} &=z \\
	t^{\prime} &=t
\end{align*}
\subsubsection{Inverse transformation}
\begin{align*}
	x&=x^{\prime}+v t^{\prime}\\  y&=y^{\prime} \\z&=z^{\prime} \\
	t&=t^{\prime}
\end{align*}
\subsubsection{Velocity transformation}
\begin{align*}
	u_{x}^{\prime}&=u_{x}-v \\u_{y}^{\prime}&=u_{y}\\ u_{z}^{\prime}&=u_{z}
	\intertext { \textbf{Inverse Velocity Transformation }}
	u_{x}&=u_{x}^{\prime}+v \\ u_{y}&=u_{y}^{\prime} \\ u_{z}&=u_{z}^{\prime}
\end{align*}
\subsubsection{Transformation of acceleration}
Let $ a $ and  ${a}^{\prime}$  be the acceleration in ${S}$ and ${S}^{\prime}$ frame of reference.\\
We have, 
\begin{align*}
a^{\prime}&=\frac{d u^{\prime}}{d t}\\&=\frac{d(u-v)}{d t}\hspace{3cm} [\because v=0]\\&=\frac{d u}{d t}-0\\&=a\\
\intertext{$\therefore$ Acceleration is invariant under Galilean transformation.}
\end{align*}
\section{Postulates of Special Theory of Relativity}
Einstein in 1905 , formulated this special theory of relativity on the basis of following postulates:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{The laws of physics are same in all inertial frames. This is the principle of relativity.}
	\item \textbf{The speed of light in vacuum is constant and same as observed from all inertial frames. This is known as the principle of constant of speed of light.}
\end{enumerate}

The first postulate implies that not only the laws of mechanics but also that of electrodynamics and optics should be same for all inertial reference systems. There is no privileged frame like ether or absolute space.\\\\
 If Einstein's postulate that the velocity of light is the same in all inertial frames  is correct, then the Galilean transformation is not the correct way to transform space-time coordinates between two inertial frames.einstein showed that, Maxwell's theory is consistent with special relativity whereas, Newtonian mechanics is not, and his modification of these branches of physics into accord.
 \section{Lorentz transformation}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=5cm,width=10cm]{lorentz}
	\caption{Lorentz transformation}
	\label{}
\end{figure}
Since the Galilean transformations are inconstitent with some branches of physics we need to replace it with new one. Here we shall derive new equations  using the postulates of special relativity theory and in addition, the assumptio that space and time are homogeneous (All points in space and time are equivalent) \\\\
Our problem can be exactly formulated in the following manner. What are the
values $\mathrm{x}^{\prime}, \mathrm{y}^{\prime}, \mathrm{z}^{\prime}, \mathrm{t}^{\prime}$, of an event with respect to $\mathrm{S}^{\prime}$, when the magnitudes $\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}, \mathrm{z}, \mathrm{t}$, of the
same event with respect to $\mathrm{S}$ are given . The relations must be so chosen that the law of the
transmission of light in vacuum is satisfied for one and the same ray of light
 with respect to $\mathrm{S}$ and $\mathrm{S}^{\prime}$. For the relative orientation in space of the co-
ordinate systems , this problem is solved by means of the equations:
\begin{align*}
	x^{\prime} &=\frac{x-v t}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \hspace{2cm} \text{Since,}\ \gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}} \\
	x^{\prime} &=\gamma ({x-v t})\\
	y^{\prime} &=y \\
	z^{\prime} &=z \\
	t^{\prime} &=\frac{t-\frac{v x}{c^{2}}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\\
	t^{\prime} &=\gamma ({t-\frac{v x}{c^{2}}})
	\intertext{This system of equations is known as \textbf{Lorentz transformation equations}.}
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
\intertext{And the inverse transformations are relating $S$\ to \ $S^{\prime}$,}
	x&=\frac{x^{\prime}+v t^{\prime}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}} \\
	x&=\gamma (x^{\prime}+v t^{\prime})\\
	y&=y^{\prime} \\
	z&=z^{\prime} \\
	t&=\frac{t^{\prime}+v x^{\prime} / c^{2}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}\\
	t&=\gamma ( t^{\prime}+v x^{\prime} / c^{2})
\end{align*}
\subsection{Velocity transformation}
Thr transformation equations for velocity in Lorentz transformation can be written as,
\begin{align*}
u_{x}^{\prime}&=\frac{u_{x}-v}{1-u_{x} v / c^{2}}\\u_{y}^{\prime}&=\frac{u_{y} \sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}{1-u_{x} v / c^{2}}\\
u_{z}^{\prime}&=\frac{u_{z} \sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}{1-{u_{x} v / c^{2}}}
\intertext{And the inverse transformations are,}
u_{x}&=\frac{u_{x}^{\prime}+v}{1+u_{x}^{\prime} v / c^{2}}\\
u_{y}&=\frac{u_{y}^{\prime} \sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}{1+u_{x}^{\prime} v / c^{2}}\\
u_{z}&=\frac{u_{z}^{\prime} \sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}{1+u_{x}^{\prime} v / c^{2}}
\end{align*}
\section{Length contraction}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=5cm,width=10cm]{length contraction}
	\caption{Length contraction}
	\label{Length contraction}
\end{figure}
If there is a relative motion  between the object and obsever in a system, There will be a discrepancy in measuring it's length .\\
The length $L$ of an object in motion with respect to an observer always appears to the observer to be shorter than it's length $L_{0}$ when it is at rest with respect to the observer. This contraction occurs only in the direction of the relative motion. The length $L_{0}$ of an object in its rest frame is called it's \textbf{proper length}.
\begin{align*}
\intertext { Proper length of rod,} {L}_{0}&=\left({x}_{2}-{x}_{1}\right)\\
\intertext{If $x$ -coordinates of the ends of the rod in reference frame $S^{\prime}$, moving with uniform velocity $v$ with respect to
	frame $\mathrm{S}$ be $\mathrm{x}_{1}^{\prime}$ and $\mathrm{x}_{2}^{\prime}$, as noted simultaneously at same instant $\mathrm{t}^{\prime}$, we have length of rod in moving reference frame $\mathrm{S}^{\prime}$ given by ,}
{L}&=\left({x}_{2}^{\prime}-{x}_{1}^{\prime}\right)
\intertext{According to Lorentz transformation,}
{x}_{1}&=\frac{{{x}_{1}}^{\prime}+{vt}}{\sqrt{1-{v}^{2} / {c}^{2}}} \quad; \quad{x}_{2} =\frac{ {{x}_{2}}^{\prime}+{vt}^{\prime}}{\sqrt{1-{v}^{2} / {c}^{2}}}\\
\text{Then,}\quad L_{0}&=x_{2}-x_{1}\\&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}  / c^{2}}}\left[x_{2}^{\prime}-x_{1}^{\prime}\right]\\
L_{0}&=\frac{L}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}\\
L_{0}&=\gamma L \hspace{2cm} \text{Since,}\ \gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}
\end{align*}
\begin{center}
	\framebox{
		\parbox[t][0.8cm]{8cm}{
			
			\addvspace{0.2cm} \centering 
			
			$ L_{0}=\gamma L $ \qquad $\Rightarrow \quad L_{0}=\frac{L}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}$} }
\end{center}
\section{Time dilation}
Measurements of time intervals are affected by relative motion between an observer
and what is observed. As a result, a clock that moves with respect to an observer ticks
more slowly than it does without such motion, and all processes  occur more slowly to an observer when they take place in a different inertial frame.\\\\
Let we have two frame of reference, ${S}$ and ${S}^{\prime}$, the former at rest and latter moving with uniform velocity ${v}$, along +ve x-direction.\\
If two events occur at any given point $x$ in frame ${S}^{\prime}$, at time ${t}_{1}^{\prime}$ and $t_{2}^{\prime}$, as noted in the clock carried by it and
at times ${t}_{1}$ and ${t}_{2}$, as noted on the clock carried by frame ${S}$.
\begin{align*}
\intertext{Time interval between two events in frame S,}
\Delta t_{0}&=\left(t_{2}-t_{1}\right)
\intertext{ And we  have time interval between two events, in frame ${S}^{\prime}$}
\Delta t&=\left(t_{2}^{\prime}-t_{1}^{\prime}\right)
\intertext{We have Lorentz transformation equations as, }
t_{1}&=\frac{t_{1}^{\prime}+v_{x}^{\prime} / c^{2}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \quad ; \quad t_{2}=\frac{t_{2}^{\prime}+v_{x}^{\prime} / t^{2}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}
\intertext{ Then we get the time interval as,}
\Delta t_{0}&=\left(t_{2}-t_{1}\right)\\
&=\frac{t_{2}^{\prime}- t_{1}^{\prime}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}\\&=\frac{\Delta t}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}\\
\Delta t_{0}&=\frac{ t_{\text{p}}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}\qquad \Delta t=t_{\text{p}}\\
\Delta t_{0}&=\gamma \ t_{\text{p}}
\end{align*}
Where $t_{\text{p}}$ is the proper time .
\section{Relative velocity}
There is one inertial frame $S, S^{\prime}$ is another inertial frame moving with respect to $S$ in
$x$ -direction and $A$ is another inertial frame which is moving with respect to $S^{\prime}$ with
velocity component $\left(u_{x}^{\prime}, u_{y}^{\prime}, u_{z}^{\prime}\right)$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{So}, \quad u_{x}^{\prime}&=\frac{d x^{\prime}}{d t^{\prime}} \quad u_{y}^{\prime}=\frac{d y^{\prime}}{d t^{\prime}} \quad u_{z}^{\prime}=\frac{d z^{\prime}}{d t^{\prime}}\\
\intertext{The velocity component of $A$ from $S$ frame is given by,}
u_{x}&=\frac{d x}{d t}, \quad u_{y}=\frac{d y}{d t}, \quad u_{z}=\frac{d z}{d t}
\intertext{ And we  have time interval between two events, in frame ${S}^{\prime}$,}
x&=\gamma\left(x^{\prime}+v t^{\prime}\right), y=y^{\prime}, z=z^{\prime}, t=\gamma\left(t^{\prime}+\frac{v x^{\prime}}{c^{2}}\right)\\\text{Where}\quad \gamma&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
\intertext { Differentiating both sides, we get ,}
d x&=\gamma\left(d x^{\prime}+v d t^{\prime}\right), \quad d y=d y^{\prime}, \quad d z=d z^{\prime}, \quad d t=\gamma\left(d t^{\prime}+\frac{v d x^{\prime}}{c^{2}}\right)\\
u_{x}&=\frac{d x}{d t}=\gamma\left(\frac{d x^{\prime}+v d t^{\prime}}{d t^{\prime}+\frac{v d x^{\prime}}{c^{2}}}\right)=\frac{\frac{d x^{\prime}}{d t^{\prime}}+v}{1+\frac{v}{c^{2}} \frac{d x^{\prime}}{d t^{\prime}}} \Rightarrow u_{x}=\frac{u_{x}^{\prime}+v}{1+\frac{v}{c^{2}} u_{x}^{\prime}}\\
u_{y}&=\frac{d y}{d t}=\frac{d y^{\prime}}{\gamma\left(d t^{\prime}+\frac{v d x^{\prime}}{c^{2}}\right)}=\frac{\frac{d y^{\prime}}{d t^{\prime}}}{\gamma\left(1+\frac{v}{c^{2}} \frac{d x^{\prime}}{d t^{\prime}}\right)} \quad \Rightarrow u_{y}=\frac{u_{y}^{\prime}}{\gamma\left(1+\frac{v u_{x}^{\prime}}{c^{2}}\right)}\\
u_{z}&=\frac{d z}{d t}=\frac{d z^{\prime}}{\gamma\left(d t^{\prime}+\frac{v d x^{\prime}}{c^{2}}\right)}=\frac{\frac{d z^{\prime}}{d t^{\prime}}}{\gamma\left(1+\frac{v}{c^{2}} \frac{d x^{\prime}}{d t^{\prime}}\right)} \Rightarrow u_{z}=\frac{u_{z}^{\prime}}{\gamma\left(1+\frac{v u_{x}}{c^{2}}\right)}\\
\text { Similarly ,}\quad  u_{x}^{\prime}&=\frac{u_{x}-v}{1-\frac{v u_{x}}{c^{2}}}, \quad u_{y}^{\prime}=\frac{u_{y}}{\gamma\left(1-\frac{v u_{x}}{c^{2}}\right)}, \quad u_{z}^{\prime}=\frac{u_{z}}{\gamma\left(1-\frac{v u_{x}}{c^{2}}\right)}
\end{align*}

		\parbox[t][5cm]{4cm}{
			
			\addvspace{0.2cm} \centering 
		\begin{align*}
		u_{x}&=\frac{u_{x}^{\prime}+v}{1+\frac{v}{c^{2}} u_{x}^{\prime}}\\

\section{Relativistic mass}
The mass of a body moving at the speed v relative to an observer is larger than its mass when at rest relative to the observer by the factor, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}$
\begin{align*}
\text { Thus } \quad m&=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
\intertext{Where $m_{0}$ is rest mass of body and $\mathrm{m}$ is observed mass.}
\end{align*}
\subsection{Relativistic momentum}
$$
p=m v=\frac{m_{0} v}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
$$
\subsection{Mass and energy}
As we recall from elementary physics, the work $W$ done on an object by a constant force of magnitude F that acts through the distance $s$, where $F$ is in the same direction as $s$, is given by $W=$ Fs. If no other forces act on the object and the object starts from rest, all the work done on it becomes kinetic energy $\mathrm{KE}$, so $\mathrm{KE}=$ Fs. In the general case where F need not be constant, the formula for kinetic energy is the integral
$$
\mathrm{KE}=\int_{0}^{s} F d s
$$
In nonrelativistic physics, the kinetic energy of an object of mass $m$ and speed $v$ is $\mathrm{KE}=\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{~m} v^{2}$. To find the correct relativistic formula for $\mathrm{KE}$ we start from the relativistic form of the second law of motion, which gives
$$\mathrm{KE}=\int_{0}^{s} \frac{d(\gamma m v)}{d t} d s=\int_{0}^{m v} v d(\gamma m v)=\int_{0}^{v} v d\left(\frac{m v}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}\right)$$
$\text { Integrating by parts }\left(\int x d y=x y-\int y d x\right) \text {, }$
\begin{align}
	\mathrm{KE} &=\frac{m v^{2}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}-m \int_{0}^{v} \frac{v d v}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}} \notag \\
	&=\frac{m v^{2}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}+\left[m c^{2} \sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}\right]_{0}^{v} \notag \\
	&=\frac{m c^{2}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}-m c^{2}\notag\\
	\mathrm{KE}&=\gamma m c^{2}-m c^{2}=(\gamma-1) m c^{2} \label{3.1}
\end{align}
This result states that the kinetic energy of an object is equal to the difference between $\gamma m c^{2}$ and $m c^{2}$. Equation (\ref{3.1}) may be written\\
Total energy
$$
E=\gamma m c^{2}=m c^{2}+\mathrm{KE}
$$
If we interpret $\gamma m c^{2}$ as the total energy $E$ of the object, we see that when it is at rest and $\mathrm{KE}=0$, it nevertheless possesses the energy $m c^{2}$. Accordingly $m c^{2}$ is called the rest energy $E_{0}$ of something whose mass is $m$. We therefore have
$$
E=E_{0}+\mathrm{KE}
$$
 where   
 \begin{equation}
 \text{Rest energy} \quad
 E_{0}=m c^{2} \label{ref3.2}
 \end{equation}
 If the object is moving, its total energy is 
 \begin{equation}
\text{ Total energy} \quad
 E=\gamma m c^{2}=\frac{m c^{2}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}
 \end{equation}
 \begin{figure}[H]
 	\centering
 	\includegraphics[height=5cm,width=5cm]{str-crop}
 	\caption{ A comparison between the classical and relativistic formulas for the ratio between kinetic energy $\mathrm{KE}$ of a moving body and its rest energy $\mathrm{mc}^{2}$. At low speeds the two formulas give the same result, but they diverge at speeds approaching that of light.}

 \end{figure}
\begin{exercise}
	A stationary body explodes into two fragments each of mass $1.0 \mathrm{~kg}$ that move apart at speeds of $0.6 c$ relative to the original body. Find the mass of the original body.
\end{exercise}
\begin{answer}
	The rest energy of the original body must equal the sum of the total energies of the fragments. Hence
	$$
	E_{0}=m c^{2}=\gamma m_{1} c^{2}+\gamma m_{2} c^{2}=\frac{m_{1} c^{2}}{\sqrt{1-v_{1}^{2} / c^{2}}}+\frac{m_{2} c^{2}}{\sqrt{1-v_{2}^{2} / c^{2}}}
	$$
	and
	$$
	m=\frac{E_{0}}{c^{2}}=\frac{(2)(1.0 \mathrm{~kg})}{\sqrt{1-(0.60)^{2}}}=2.5 \mathrm{~kg}
	$$
\end{answer}
 \subsection{Energy and Momentum}
 Total energy and momentum are conserved in an isolated system, and the rest energy of a particle is invariant. Hence these quantities are in some sense more fundamental than velocity or kinetic energy, which are neither. Let us look into how the total energy, rest energy, and momentum of a particle are related.
 \begin{align}
  \text { Total energy } \quad
 E&=\frac{m c^{2}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}} \label{ref3.4}\\
 \text{ and square it to give} \quad
 E^{2}&=\frac{m^{2} c^{4}}{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}\notag\\
\text{Momentum} \quad p&=\frac{m v}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}} \label{ref3.5}\\
\text{we find that} \quad p^{2} c^{2}&=\frac{m^{2} v^{2} c^{2}}{1-v^{2} / c^{2}} \notag\\
\text{Now we subtract} \quad p^{2} c^{2}\quad  \text{from} \quad E^{2} \notag \\
E^{2}-p^{2} c^{2} &=\frac{m^{2} c^{4}-m^{2} v^{2} c^{2}}{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}=\frac{m^{2} c^{4}\left(1-v^{2} / c^{2}\right)}{1-v^{2} / c^{2}} \notag \\
&=\left(m c^{2}\right)^{2}\notag\\
\text{Energy and momentum} \quad
E^{2}&=\left(m c^{2}\right)^{2}+p^{2} c^{2} \label{ref3.6}
 \end{align}
  Because $m c^{2}$ is invariant, so is $E^{2}-p^{2} c^{2}$ : this quantity for a particle has the same value in all frames of reference.
\textbf{massless particles}\\
 A particle must have rest mass in order to have energy and momentum, but in relativistic mechanics this requirement does not hold.\\
 From Eqs. (\ref{ref3.4}) and (\ref{ref3.5}), when $m=0$ and $v<< c$, it is clear that $E=p=0$. A massless particle with a speed less than that of light can have neither energy nor momentum. However, when $m=0$ and $v=c, E=0 / 0$ and $p=0 / 0$, which are indeterminate: $E$ and $p$ can have any values. Thus Eqs. (\ref{ref3.4}) and (\ref{ref3.5}) are consistent with the existence of massless particles that possess energy and momentum provided that they travel with the speed of light.
 
 Equation (\ref{ref3.6}) gives us the relationship between $E$ and $p$ for a particle with $m=0$ :\\
 
 Massless particle
 $$E=p c$$
 \begin{exercise}
 	An electron $\left(m=0.511 \mathrm{MeV} / \mathrm{c}^{2}\right)$ and a photon $(m=0)$ both have momenta of $2.000 \mathrm{MeV} / \mathrm{c}$. Find the total energy of each.
 \end{exercise}
\begin{answer}
 (a) the electron's total energy is\\
 \begin{align*}
 	E &=\sqrt{m^{2} c^{4}+p^{2} c^{2}}=\sqrt{\left(0.511 \mathrm{MeV} / c^{2}\right)^{2} c^{4}+(2.000 \mathrm{MeV} / c)^{2} c^{2}} \\
 	&=\sqrt{(0.511 \mathrm{MeV})^{2}+(2.000 \mathrm{MeV})^{2}}=2.064 \mathrm{MeV}
 \end{align*}
 (b) The photon's total energy is\\\\
 $E=p c=(2.000 \mathrm{MeV} / c) c=2.000 \mathrm{MeV}$	
\end{answer}
\section{Space time}
 A length that one observer can measure with only a meter stick may have to be measured with both a meter stick and a clock by another observer. A convenient and elegant way to express the results of special relativity is to regard events as occurring in a four-dimensional spacetime in which the usual three coordinates $x, y, z$ refer to space and a fourth coordinate ict refers to time, where $i=\sqrt{-1}$. Although we cannot visualize spacetime, it is no harder to deal with mathematically than three-dimensional space.
The reason that $i c t$ is chosen as the time coordinate instead of just $t$ is that the quantity
$$
s^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-(c t)^{2}
$$
is invariant under a Lorentz transformation. That is, if an event occurs at $x, y, z, t$ in an inertial frame $S$ and at $x^{\prime}, y^{\prime}, z^{\prime}, t^{\prime}$ in another inertial frame $S^{\prime}$, then
$$
s^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-(c t)^{2}=x^{\prime 2}+y^{\prime 2}+z^{\prime 2}-\left(c t^{\prime}\right)^{2}
$$
Because $s^{2}$ is invariant, we can think of a Lorentz transformation merely as the orthogonal transformation due to rotation of axes  in spacetime.
\section{Structure of space time}

 The Lorentz transformations take on a simpler appearance when expressed in terms of the quantities
$$
x^{0} \equiv c t, \quad \beta \equiv \frac{v}{c}
$$
Using $x^{0}$ (instead of $t$ ) and $\beta$ (instead of $v$ ) amounts to changing the unit of time from the second to the meter-1 meter of $x^{0}$ corresponds to the time it takes light to travel 1 meter (in vacuum). If, at the same time, we number the $x, y, z$ coordinates, so that
$$x^{1}=x, \quad x^{2}=y, \quad x^{3}=z$$
 then the Lorentz transformations read
 $$\left.\begin{array}{l}
 	\bar{x}^{0}=\gamma\left(x^{0}-\beta x^{1}\right), \\
 	\bar{x}^{1}=\gamma\left(x^{1}-\beta x^{0}\right), \\
 	\bar{x}^{2}=x^{2}, \\
 	\bar{x}^{3}=x^{3} .
 \end{array}\right\}$$
 Or, in matrix form:
 $$\left(\begin{array}{c}
 	\bar{x}^{0} \\
 	\bar{x}^{1} \\
 	\bar{x}^{2} \\
 	\bar{x}^{3}
 \end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
 	\gamma & -\gamma \beta & 0 & 0 \\
 	-\gamma \beta & \gamma & 0 & 0 \\
 	0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 	0 & 0 & 0 & 1
 \end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
 	x^{0} \\
 	x^{1} \\
 	x^{2} \\
 	x^{3}
 \end{array}\right)$$
 Letting Greek indices run from 0 to 3 , this can be distilled into a single equation:
 $$
 \bar{x}^{\mu}=\sum_{\nu=0}^{3}\left(\Lambda_{\nu}^{\mu}\right) x^{\nu}
 $$
$\text { where } \Lambda \text { is the Lorentz transformation matrix }$\\
\subsection{Four vectors}
 we defined a (3-)vector as any set of three components that transform under rotations the same way $(x, y, z)$ do; by extension, we now define a 4-vector as any set of four components that transform in the same manner as $\left(x^{0}, x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3}\right)$ under Lorentz transformations:\\
 $$\bar{a}^{\mu}=\sum_{\nu=0}^{3} \Lambda_{\nu}^{\mu} a^{\nu}$$
 For the particular case of a transformation along the x axis, 
$$\begin{aligned}
	&\bar{a}^{0}=\gamma\left(a^{0}-\beta a^{1}\right) \\
	&\bar{a}^{1}=\gamma\left(a^{1}-\beta a^{0}\right) \\
	&\bar{a}^{2}=a^{2} \\
	&\bar{a}^{3}=a^{3}

There is a 4-vector analog to the dot product $\left(\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} \equiv A_{x} B_{x}+A_{y} B_{y}+A_{z} B_{z}\right)$, but it's not just the sum of the products of like components; rather, the zeroth components have a minus sign:
$$
-a^{0} b^{0}+a^{1} b^{1}+a^{2} b^{2}+a^{3} b^{3} .
$$
 This is the four-dimensional scalar product;\\
 $$
 -\bar{a}^{0} \bar{b}^{0}+\bar{a}^{1} \bar{b}^{1}+\bar{a}^{2} \bar{b}^{2}+\bar{a}^{3} \bar{b}^{3}=-a^{0} b^{0}+a^{1} b^{1}+a^{2} b^{2}+a^{3} b^{3}
 $$
 just as the ordinary dot product is invariant (unchanged) under rotations, this combination is invariant under Lorentz transformations.
To keep track of the minus sign, it is convenient to introduce the covariant vector $a_{\mu}$, which differs from the contravariant $a^{\mu}$ only in the sign of the zeroth component:
$$
a_{\mu}=\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}\right) \equiv\left(-a^{0}, a^{1}, a^{2}, a^{3}\right)
$$
 Formally,
 $a_{\mu}=\sum_{\nu=0}^{3} g_{\mu \nu} a^{\nu}, \quad \text { where } \quad g_{\mu \nu} \equiv\left(\begin{array}{rrrr}
 	-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 	0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 	0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 	0 & 0 & 0 & 1
 \end{array}\right)$
 is the (Minkowski) metric.
The scalar product can now be written with the summation symbol,
$$
\sum_{\mu=0}^{3} a^{\mu} b_{\mu}
$$
or, more compactly still,
$$
a^{\mu} b_{\mu} \text {. }
$$
 Of course, we could just as well take care of the minus sign by switching to covariant $b$ :
$$
a_{\mu} b^{\mu}=a^{\mu} b_{\mu}=-a^{0} b^{0}+a^{1} b^{1}+a^{2} b^{2}+a^{3} b^{3} .
$$
\subsection{Examples of four vectors}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{ Position four-vector $ x_{\mu}$}\\
	It is expressed as $x_{\mu}=\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}\right)=(\mathbf{r}, i c t)$
	\item \textbf{ Four-velocity or velocity four-vector $u_{\mu}$}\\
	\begin{align*}
		u_{1}&=\frac{d x_{1}}{d \tau}=\frac{d x_{1}}{d t} \frac{d t}{d \tau}=\frac{d x}{d t} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}=\frac{u_{x}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}} \\
		u_{2}&=\frac{d x_{2}}{d \tau}=\frac{d x_{2}}{d t} \frac{d t}{d \tau}=\frac{d y}{d t} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}=\frac{u_{y}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}} \\
		u_{3}&=\frac{d x_{3}}{d \tau}=\frac{d x_{3}}{d t} \frac{d t}{d \tau}=\frac{d z}{d t} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}=\frac{u_{z}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}} \\
		u_{4}&=\frac{d x_{4}}{d \tau}=\frac{d(i c t)}{d t} \frac{d t}{d \tau}=\frac{i c}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}\\
		\text{where} \quad \frac{d t}{d \tau}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}\\
		\text{Hence} \quad u_{\mu}&=\left(u_{1}, u_{2}, u_{3}, u_{4}\right)\\
		or \quad u_{\mu}&=\left(\frac{u_{x}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}, \frac{u_{y}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}, \frac{u_{z}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}, \frac{i c}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}\right)\\
		i.e., \quad u_{\mu}&=\left(\frac{\mathbf{u}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}, \frac{i c}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}\right)
	\end{align*}
	where $\mathbf{u}=d \mathbf{r} / d t$ is the three dimensional velocity vector.
	The square of the magnitude of the velocity four vector is given by
	$$
	u_{\mu} u_{\mu}=\frac{u^{2}}{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}-\frac{c^{2}}{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}=-c^{2}
	$$
	which is Lorentz invariant.
	\item \textbf{ Momentum four vector $p_{\mu}$}
	\begin{align*}
		&p_{1}=m_{0} u_{1}=\frac{m_{0} u_{x}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}=m u_{x}=p_{x} \\
		&p_{2}=m_{0} u_{2}=\frac{m_{0} u_{y}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}=m u_{y}=p_{y} \\
		&p_{3}=m_{0} u_{3}=\frac{m_{0} u_{z}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}=m u_{z}=p_{z} \\
		&p_{4}=m_{0} u_{4}=\frac{m_{0} i c}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}=i m c=i \frac{E}{c}
	\end{align*}
	Hence,
	$$
	p_{\mu}=\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}\right)=\left(p_{x}, p_{y}, p_{z}, i m c\right)=(\mathbf{p}, i E / c) \text { with } \mathbf{p}=m \mathbf{u}
	$$
	The square of the magnitude of the four-momentum is given by
	$$
	p_{\mu} p_{\mu}=p^{2}-\frac{E^{2}}{c^{2}}=-\left(E^{2}-p^{2} c^{2}\right) / c^{2} \quad \text { or } \quad p_{\mu} p_{\mu}=-m_{0}^{2} c^{2}
	$$
	This $p_{\mu}$ is also called energy-momentum four-vector.
	\item \textbf{ Acceleration four-vector $a_{\mu}$}\\
	\begin{align*}
	a_{1}&=\frac{d u_{1}}{d \tau}=\frac{d u_{1}}{d t} \frac{d t}{d \tau}=\frac{d}{d t}\left(\frac{u_{x}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}\right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}\\
	&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}} \cdot\left(\frac{u_{x}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}+\frac{u_{x} u \dot{u}}{c^{2}\left(1-u^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}}\right)\\
	u^{2}&=u_{x}^{2}+u_{y}^{2}+u_{z}^{2} \text { and hence, } u \dot{u}=u_{x} \dot{u}_{x}+u_{y} \dot{u}_{y}+u_{z} \dot{u}_{z}=\mathbf{u} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{u}}\\
	a_{1}&=\frac{\dot{u}_{x}}{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}+\frac{u_{x}(\mathbf{u} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{u}})}{c^{2}\left(1-u^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{2}}\\
	a_{2}&=\frac{\dot{u}_{y}}{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}+\frac{u_{y}(\mathbf{u} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{u}})}{c^{2}\left(1-u^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{2}}\\
	a_{3}&=\frac{\dot{u}_{z}}{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}+\frac{u_{z}(\mathbf{u} \cdot \dot{\mathbf{u}})}{c^{2}\left(1-u^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{2}}\\
	a_{4}&=\frac{d u_{4}}{d \tau}=\frac{d u_{4}}{d t} \frac{d t}{d \tau}=\frac{d}{d t}\left(\frac{i c}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}\right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}=\frac{i(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u})}{c\left(1-u^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{2}}\\
	\text { Thus, } \quad a_{\mu}&=\left(\frac{\mathbf{a}}{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}+\frac{\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a})}{c^{2}\left(1-u^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{2}}, \frac{i(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a})}{c\left(1-u^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{2}}\right)\\
\text{where} \mathbf{a}&=\dot{\mathbf{u}}=\dot{u}_{x} \hat{\mathbf{i}}+\dot{u}_{y} \hat{\mathbf{j}}+\dot{u}_{z} \hat{\mathbf{k}}
	\end{align*}
	\item \textbf { Four-force or Minkowski force } $F_{\mu}$\\
	\begin{align}
	F_{\mu}&=\frac{d p_{\mu}}{d \tau}=\frac{d}{d \tau}\left(m_{0} u_{\mu}\right)=m_{0} \frac{d u_{\mu}}{d \tau}=m_{0} \frac{d^{2} x_{\mu}}{d \tau^{2}} \notag\\
	\intertext{This equation is called the Minkowski force equation}
	\intertext{The components of four-force $F_{\mu}$ are}
	F_{1}&=\frac{d p_{1}}{d \tau}=\frac{d p_{1}}{d t} \frac{d t}{d \tau}=\frac{d p_{x}}{d t} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}=\frac{F_{x}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}\notag \\
	F_{2}&=\frac{F_{y}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}} \notag\\
	F_{3}&=\frac{F_{z}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}} \notag\\
	F_{4}&=\frac{d p_{4}}{d \tau}=\frac{d p_{4}}{d t} \frac{d t}{d \tau}=\gamma \frac{d}{d t}\left(\frac{i E}{c}\right)=\frac{i \gamma}{c} \frac{d E}{d t} \notag\\
	F_{\mu}&=\left(\frac{\mathbf{F}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}, \frac{i \gamma}{c} \frac{d E}{d t}\right) \label{ref.str1}\\
	\intertext{The four-force may be expressed in terms of four-acceleration vector as}
	F_{\mu}&=\frac{d p_{\mu}}{d \tau}=\frac{d}{d \tau}\left(m_{0} u_{\mu}\right)=m_{0} \frac{d u_{\mu}}{d \tau}=m_{0} a_{\mu}\notag\\
	F_{\mu}&=\left(\frac{m_{0} \mathbf{a}}{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}+\frac{m_{0} \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a})}{c^{2}\left(1-u^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{2}}, \frac{i m_{0}(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a})}{c\left(1-u^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{2}}\right)\label{ref.str2}\\
	\intertext {Since both equation $\ref{ref.str1}$ and $\ref{ref.str2}$ are the same, equating the space part of $F_{\mu}$,}  \text { we obtain }
	\mathbf{F}&=\frac{m_{0} \mathbf{a}}{\left(1-u^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}}+\frac{m_{0} \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a})}{c^{2}\left(1-u^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} \label{ref.str3}\\
	\mathbf{F}&=m \mathbf{a}+\frac{-m \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a})}{c^{2}-u^{2}} \notag\\
	\intertext { where $\mathbf{F}=d \mathbf{p} / d t$  is the three-dimensional force vector and in general is not equal to $ m \mathbf{a}$} \notag\\
	\text { The fourth component of } &F_{\mu} in \ref{ref.str2} \text { can be written as }\notag \\
	\frac{i m_{0}(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a})}{c\left(1-u^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{2}}&=\frac{i \gamma}{c}(\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{u})\label{ref.str4} \\
	\text { because using ($\ref{ref.str3}$) } \notag \\
	\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{u}&=\frac{m_{0}(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a})}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}+\frac{m_{0}(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u})(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a})}{c^{2}\left(1-u^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}}=\frac{m_{0}(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a})}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}\left[1+\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}-u^{2}}\right] \label{str4}\\
	&=\frac{m_{0}(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a})}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}} \frac{1}{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}=\frac{m_{0}(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{a})}{\left(1-u^{2} / c^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} \notag\\
	\intertext { Thus the fourth component of $F_{\mu}$ from ($\ref{ref.str1}$)  and ($\ref{ref.str4}$) is }\\
	\frac{i \gamma}{c} \frac{d E}{d t}&=\frac{i \gamma}{c}(\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{u}) \text { or } \frac{d E}{d t}=\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{u} \label{str5}		
	\end{align}
	The right hand side of eq. ($\ref{str5}$) represents the power and the left hand side for a single particle $d E / d t=d\left(m c^{2}\right) / d t$ represents the rate of change of energy. This is in accordance with the conservation of energy.\\
	Thus the four-force
	$F_{\mu}$ is represented as\\
	\begin{equation}
	F_{\mu}=\left(\frac{\mathbf{F}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}, \frac{i(\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{u})}{c \sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}\right)
	\end{equation}
	The Minkowski force equation is
	$F_{\mu}=\frac{d p_{\mu}}{d \tau}=m_{0} \frac{d u_{\mu}}{d \tau}$
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{The space time interval} The scalar product of a 4-vector with itself, $a^{\mu} a_{\mu}=-\left(a^{0}\right)^{2}+\left(a^{1}\right)^{2}+\left(a^{2}\right)^{2}+\left(a^{3}\right)^{2}$, can be positive (if the "spatial" terms dominate) or negative (if the "temporal" term dominates) or zero:\\
If $a^{\mu} a_{\mu}>0, a^{\mu}$ is called spacelike.\\
If $a^{\mu} a_{\mu}<0, a^{\mu}$ is called timelike.\\
If $a^{\mu} a_{\mu}=0, a^{\mu}$ is called lightlike.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=6cm,width=6cm]{str1}
	\caption{}
	\label{fig3.5}
\end{figure}
 Figure $\ref{fig3.5}$ shows two events plotted on the axes $x$ and $c t$. Event 1 occurs at $x=0, t=0$ and event 2 occurs at $x=\Delta x, t=\Delta t$. The spacetime interval $\Delta \mathrm{s}$ between them is defined by\\
 $$\text{ Spacetime interval
 	events}\quad \quad \quad(\Delta s)^{2}=(c \Delta t)^{2}-(\Delta x)^{2}$$
 The virtue of this definition is that $(\Delta s)^{2}$, like the $s^{2}$  is invariant under Lorentz transformations. If $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$ are the differences in space and time between two events measured in the $S$ frame and $\Delta x^{\prime}$ and $\Delta t^{\prime}$ are the same quantities measured in the $S^{\prime}$ frame,
$$(\Delta s)^{2}=(c \Delta t)^{2}-(\Delta x)^{2}=\left(c \Delta t^{\prime}\right)^{2}-\left(\Delta x^{\prime}\right)^{2}$$
Now let us look into the possible relationships between events 1 and 2 . Event 2 can be related causally in some way to event 1 provided that a signal traveling slower than the speed of light can connect these events, that is, provided that
$$
c \Delta t>|\Delta x|
$$
or
Timelike interval
$$(\Delta s)^{2}>0$$
An interval in which $(\Delta s)^{2}>0$ is said to be timelike. Every timelike interval that connects event 1 with another event lies within the light cones bounded by $x=\pm c t$. All events that could have affected event 1 lie in the past light cone; all events that event 1 is able to affect lie in the future light cone. (Events connected by timelike intervals need not necessarily be related, of course, but it is possible for them to be related.)
Conversely, the criterion for there being no causal relationship between events 1 and 2 is that
$$
c \Delta t<|\Delta x|
$$
or
Spacelike interval
$$(\Delta s)^{2}<0$$
An interval in which $(\Delta s)^{2}<0$ is said to be spacelike. Every event that is connected with event 1 by a spacelike interval lies outside the light cones of event 1 and neither has interacted with event 1 in the past nor is capable of interacting with it in the future; the two events must be entirely unrelated.
When events 1 and 2 can be connected with a light signal only,
$$
c \Delta t=|\Delta x|
$$
or
Lightlike interval
$$
\Delta s=0
$$
An interval in which $\Delta s=0$ is said to be lightlike. Events that can be connected with event 1 by lightlike intervals lie on the boundaries of the light cones.\\
These conclusions hold in terms of the light cones of event 2 because $(\Delta s)^{2}$ is invariant; for example, if event 2 is inside the past light cone of event 1 , event 1 is inside the future light cone of event 2. In general, events that lie in the future of an event as seen in one frame of reference $S$ lie in its future in every other frame $S^{\prime}$, and events that lie in the past of an event in $S$ lie in its past in every other frame $S^{\prime}$. Thus "future" and "past" have invariant meanings.

	\item Suppose you are driving your car on a business trip and are traveling at $30 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Your boss, who is waiting at your destination, expects the trip to take $5.0 \mathrm{~h}$. When you arrive late, your excuse is that your car clock registered the passage of $5.0 $ \ but that you were driving fast and so your clock ran more slowly than your boss's clock. If your car clock actually did indicate a $5.0-\mathrm{h}$ trip, how much time passed on your boss's clock, which was at rest on the Earth?
	\begin{answer}
		\begin{align*}
		\text{	Here, }\quad \gamma&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{\left(3 \times 10\  \text{m}/\text{s}^{2}\right)}{\left(3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2\right)}}}\\&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-10^{-14}}}
		\intertext{Perform binomial expansion, we get}
		\gamma&=\left(1-10^{-14}\right)^{-1 / 2} \approx 1+\frac{1}{2}\left(10^{-14}\right)=1+\frac{1}{2}\left(10\times 10^{-15}\right) \\&=1+5 \times 10^{-15}
		\intertext{In daily life, $\gamma$ is not much different from $1$.}
		\Delta t&=\gamma \Delta t_{p}\\&=\left(1+5 \times 10^{-15}\right)(5.0 \text{h})=5.0 \text{h}+2.5 \times 10^{-14} \text{h}\\&=5\text{h}+0.09 \mathrm{ns}

		u_{x}&=\frac{u_{x}^{\prime}+v}{1+\frac{u_{x}^{\prime} v}{c^{2}}}\\&=\frac{0.70 c+0.80 c}{1+\frac{(0.70  c)(0.80 c)}{c^{2}}}\\&=0.96 c

	\item An electron in a television picture tube typically moves with a speed $u=0.25 c$.  Find its total energy and kinetic energy in electron volts.

		E&=\frac{m_{e} c^{2}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\\&=\frac{0.511 \mathrm{MeV}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.250 c)^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\\
		&=0.528 \mathrm{MeV}
		\intertext{This is $3 \%$ greater than the rest energy.}
		\intertext{We obtain the kinetic energy by subtracting the rest energy from the total energy:}
		K&=E-m_{e} c^{2}\\&=0.528 \mathrm{MeV}-0.511 \mathrm{MeV}\\&=0.017 \mathrm{MeV}

	\begin{answer}
		\begin{align*}
		\text{(a)}\quad E_{R}&=m_{p} c^{2}\\&=\left(1.67 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg}\right)\left(3.00 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\right)^{2}\\
		&=\left(1.50 \times 10^{-10} J\right)\left(1.00 \mathrm{eV} / 1.60 \times 10^{-19} J\right)\\&=938 \mathrm{MeV}\\\\
		\text{(b)}\quad E&=3 m_{p} c^{2}=\frac{m_{p} c^{2}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \quad \\3&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\\
		\text{Solving }&\text{for $'u'$ gives}\\
		1-\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}&=\frac{1}{9} \quad \\ \frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}&=\frac{8}{9}  \\ u&=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8} c\\&=2.83 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\\\\
		\text{(c)}\quad K&=E-m_{p} c^{2}\\&=3 m_{p} c^{2}-m_{p} c^{2}=2 m_{p} c^{2}\\

	\item A rigid bar of length $1.5 \mathrm{~m}$ is at rest relative to frame $S^{\prime}$. If it makes an angle $\alpha^{\prime}=45^{\circ}$ with $x^{\prime}-$ axis, find the length of the bar and its orientation relative to frame $S$, when $v=0.95 c ?$
	\begin{answer}
		\begin{align*}
		\intertext{Resolving the length of the bar into components parallel to $x^{\prime}$ and $y^{\prime}$ axes, the corresponding length in $S^{\prime}$ are:}
		L_{x}^{\prime}&=L^{\prime} \cos \alpha^{\prime}=1.5 \times 1 / \sqrt{2}=1.06m;\\L_{y}^{\prime}&=L^{\prime}\sin \alpha^\prime-1.5\times1/\sqrt{2}=1.06m
		\intertext{The vertical components would show no contraction, when viewed from $S$ Horizontal component, being parallel to $v$, would}
		\therefore \quad L_{y}&=L_{y}^{\prime}=1.06 m\\
		L_{x}&=L_{x}^{\prime} \sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}=1.06 \sqrt{1-0.95^{2}}-0.331 m
		\intertext{Therefore, length of the relative $S$ is:}
		L_{1}&=\sqrt{L_{x}^{2}+L_{y}^{2}}=\sqrt{(1.06)+(0.331)}=1.11 \mathrm{~m}\\
		\intertext{	Orientation of the bar relative to $S$ is}
		\tan \alpha&=\frac{L_{y}}{L_{x}}=\frac{1.06}{0.331}=3.20 \quad \\\therefore \alpha&=72^{\circ} 40^{\prime}

	\begin{answer}
		\begin{align*}
		\intertext{ With relativistic time dilation,}
		\Delta t&=\Delta t^{\prime} / \sqrt{1-0.9^{2}}=2.3 \Delta t^{\prime}
		\intertext{Since $\Delta t^{\prime}$ is the time-interval measured by an observer moving with $\pi$ -mesons, it is the real life-time, so that}
		\intertext{$\Delta t^{\prime}=2 \times 10^{-8} s .$ So, in the lab-frame, the mean life is}
		\Delta t&=2.3 \times \Delta t^{\prime}=2.3 \times 2 \times 10^{-8} s\\&=4.6 \times 10^{-8} s
		\intertext{Therefore, average distance travelled by $\pi$ -mesons }&=v . \Delta t=0.9 \times 3 \times 10^{8} \times 4.6 \times 10^{-8} \\\mathrm{~m}&=12.42 \mathrm{~m}

	\begin{answer}
		\begin{align*}
		\intertext{Due to time-dilation, the half-life of a moving particle appears lengthened. Let $\Delta t_{0}$ be the actual half-life, i.e.,in the frame of reference of the particle, and $\Delta t$ that measured by a stationary observer.}
		\therefore \quad \Delta t&=\Delta t_{0} / \sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}\\
		\intertext{Therefore, by the problem}
		4.0 \times 10^{-8}&=\frac{\Delta t}{\sqrt{1-0.8^{2}}} ; 3.0 \times 10^{-8}=\frac{\Delta t_{0}}{\sqrt{1-0.6^{2}}}

		\intertext{Therefore, from the time-dilation relation,}
		T&=\frac{T_{0}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{1-0.8^{2}}}=3.33 s

Ifthe distance of the sun from the earth is $11 \times 10^{10} m_{i}$ find the average minimum velocity with which a neutron must leave the sun so.as to reach the earth before breaking up.
	\begin{answer}
		\begin{align*}
		\intertext{Let $v$ be the required velocity of the neutron. The time $t_{1}$ for neutron to reach the earth from the sun before decay is}
		t_{1}&=\frac{11 \times 10^{10} m}{v}\\
		\intertext{If $t_{0}$ be the life-time of neutron at rest, then the average life-time $t$ of the 'moving' neutro, as measured by an observer on earth, is}
		t&=\frac{t_{0}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}=\frac{15 \times 60 s}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}
		\intertext{Plainly, this $t$ and previous $t_{1}$ must be equal,}
		\therefore \quad \frac{11 \times 10^{10}}{v}&=\frac{15 \times 60}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} /\left(3 \times 10^{8}\right)^{2}}}
		\intertext{Simplifying, we obtain,}

		\begin{align*}
		\intertext{The velocity of the message rocket relative to a terrestrial observer is, by velocity addition theorem,}
		v&=\frac{(0.6-0.8) c}{1-0.8 \times 0.6}=\frac{-0.2 c}{1-0.48}\\
		&=-\frac{0.2 c}{0.52}\\&=-0.385 c
